## Project Summary

As the world battle against climate change, the risk of health issues from environmental hazards continues to rise. In Singapore, rising temperatures, unpredictable rainfalls, and haze pollution remains a growing concern, posing as a health risk especially to the more vulnerable in society. Furthermore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, citizens needed a means to detect and defend against airborne infectious diseases. Hence, there is a growing need for citizens to proactively safeguard themselves from the Singapore’s evolving environmental hazards. 

This project aims to develop a portable environmental monitoring device that powered by ambient energy sources, without the need for charging. This device will focus on monitor key environmental variables relevant to both indoor and outdoor settings in Singapore, providing users with real-time alerts for potential hazards. 

The report outlines the considerations taken from each stage of the project’s progressions, encompassing research, ideation, design, implementation, and tests conducted, exploring technologies from three main domains: electronics, 3D modeling and software programming. It offers insights into the challenges encountered, and the solutions devised in creating a reliable, portable, self-sustaining environmental monitoring device.
